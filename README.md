This program was created to emulate a payroll processing system in which it processes the payment of employees within a company. The payment is determined by the role of the
employee: Fulltime, Parttime, Management. One can input data into the system so that the payment for each employee during every pay period can be processed. Also incorporated
JUnit testing framework to test out specific classes.
